# Welcome

## Welcome to Marlinraker!
 Marlinraker allows you to use your favorite Klipper-based frontends
 with your Marlin 3D printer.

[Installation](/installation){ .md-button .md-button--primary }
[GitHub](https://github.com/pauhull/marlinraker){ .md-button }

Marlinraker can connect to 3D printers running Marlin firmware, for
example Prusa or Creality machines. It runs on an external host device,
like a Raspberry Pi, and connects to your printer via USB. Marlinraker works
by replicating the [Moonraker](https://github.com/Arksine/moonraker) API.
Because it runs on the Node.js runtime it can be used on low-power SBCs like the 
Raspberry Pi Zero and even on Windows machines!

Software that can be used with Marlinraker includes:

- [Mainsail](https://github.com/mainsail-crew/mainsail)
- [Fluidd](https://github.com/fluidd-core/fluidd)
- [KlipperScreen](https://github.com/jordanruthe/KlipperScreen)
- [Mooncord](https://github.com/eliteSchwein/mooncord)
- ... and much more!

Special thanks to Arksine for creating Moonraker, which this project wouldn't be possible without.
